# Villa Soccer Coaching Planner

I just wanted an app that can help me map out my players onto the field and utilise some basic timers to help me ensure equal game time with substitutes

Big TODO here that I need to populate this.  I want to add session saving and all that jazz - but at the moment once the build is done (via npm) copy the output assets onto your websever and run it.  It's a really basic app so I am not going to add complex notes to it just yet
